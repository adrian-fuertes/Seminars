"""
In this short exercise you will practice dealing with a merge conflict.
Finish the lower_case function and push your changes to the Github repository.
The fastest one to push is lucky, the others will most likely get a merge
conflict. See if you can fix it :)
"""



"""
Do the same thing again with upper_case, but change the order so everyone
experiences at least 1 merge conflict.
